# Github Webhook for Brownbaglunch

This project is a Java Application powered by VertX which listens to [Github Push Events](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent).

Each time something is pushed on [bblfr_data](https://github.com/brownbaglunch/bblfr_data), this application:

* fetch https://github.com/brownbaglunch/bblfr_data/blob/gh-pages/baggers.js
* split `data` in `baggers` and `cities` java beans
* enrich `baggers.cities` with geo location point and image of the associated city
* index `baggers` in elasticsearch. The index name is timestamped.
* move or create alias `bblfr` on the index name
* remove the old indices

Data are available in elasticsearch:

* [baggers](http://localhost:9200/bblfr/doc/_search?pretty)

## Run

To run it, you need to have Maven installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/brownbaglunch/java-webhook.git
cd java-webhook
mvn clean install
java -jar target/java-webhook-1.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar
```

It should says:

```
23:24:08,233 INFO  [f.b.w.ElasticsearchVerticle] Starting Elasticsearch Client
23:24:08,233 INFO  [f.b.w.WebhookVerticle] Starting HTTP server on port 8080
23:24:09,104 INFO  [f.b.w.WebhookVerticle] HTTP server started on port 8080
23:24:09,918 INFO  [f.b.w.s.ElasticsearchClientManager] Elasticsearch client started and connected to a cluster running version 6.1.1
```

Then just POST to http://localhost:8080/:

```sh
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/
```

And you should see:

```
23:24:12,916 INFO  [f.b.w.WebhookVerticle] Signature has not been verified. Probably Dev Mode.
23:24:12,916 INFO  [f.b.w.WebhookVerticle] Reading data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brownbaglunch/bblfr_data/gh-pages/baggers.js
23:24:16,832 INFO  [f.b.w.ElasticsearchVerticle] Let's index 243 speakers and 39 cities.
23:24:19,323 INFO  [f.b.w.ElasticsearchVerticle] Indexed in elasticsearch: OK
```

## Configuration

If you want to push to another cluster, you need to start the application with:

```sh
SOURCE=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brownbaglunch/bblfr_data/gh-pages/baggers.js \
TARGET=https://username:password@yourcluster.found.io:9243 \
TOKEN=hhdquiHdsuqiudshqhiudhuebefbbcbzbczib \
    java -jar target/java-webhook-1.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar
```

`TOKEN` value is the one you defined in [Github Hooks](https://github.com/brownbaglunch/bblfr_data/settings/hooks/).
It can be `null` (default) in development mode.

If you want to change network settings, change `PORT` system variables:

```sh
PORT=9000 java -jar target/java-webhook-1.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar
```

By default, it will listen on `0.0.0.0`, port `8080`.

## Endpoints

### Status (GET /)

If you just want to check that the service is running, call:

```sh
curl -XGET localhost:8080
```

You will get back:

```json
{
  "message" : "Vert.x is running!"
}
```

### Deploy (POST /)

If you want to run the process of reading data from Github, then sending that to elasticsearch, you need to call:

```sh
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/
```

In production (when `TOKEN` is set), you need to provide the right SHA1 signature like:

```sh
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/_stop -H "X-Hub-Signature: sha1=22202b35f1482c1a8d3d0c3f6b3c46307792d409" -d '{
  // Your content here. The signature depends on it.
}'
```

You will get back:

```json
{
  "speakers" : 243,
  "cities" : 39
}
```

### Stop the server (POST /_stop)

In production (when `TOKEN` is set), you need to provide the right SHA1 signature like:

```sh
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/_stop -H "X-Bblfr-Key: sha1=22202b35f1482c1a8d3d0c3f6b3c46307792d409"
```

In development mode, just call:

```sh
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/_stop
```

## Deployment on Clevercloud

Connect to your [Clever-cloud console](https://console.clever-cloud.com/).
Create your Java application and define your variables in the Console:

```
SOURCE=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brownbaglunch/bblfr_data/gh-pages/baggers.js
TARGET=http://bblfr:password@localhost:9200
TOKEN=12345678
PORT=8080
```

Note that `PORT` **must be** `8080`.

Add clever as a git remote repository (change `ID` below):

```ssh
git remote add clever git+ssh://git@push.par.clever-cloud.com/app_ID.git
```

Deploy!

```sh
git push -u clever master
```

Et voil√†!
